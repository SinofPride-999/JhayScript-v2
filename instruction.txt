# Distributing JhayScript to Your Friends

Here's a complete guide to help your friends install and use your JhayScript language:

## Option 1: Simple Executable Distribution (Easiest)

### What to Send Your Friends:
1. The standalone `.exe` file from your `dist` folder (`jhayscript.exe`)
2. A sample `.jhay` script file to test with

### Installation Instructions:
1. **Create a folder** for JhayScript (e.g., `C:\JhayScript`)
2. **Place the executable** in this folder
3. **Add to PATH** (so they can run it from anywhere):
   - Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, go to Advanced > Environment Variables
   - Under "System variables", select "Path" > Edit > New
   - Add the path to your folder (e.g., `C:\JhayScript`)
   - Click OK to close all dialogs

### Usage:
```cmd
jhayscript my_script.jhay
```




## Option 2: Installer Package (More Professional)

### Create an Installer:
1. Use `Inno Setup` (free) to create a Windows installer
2. The installer can:
   - Place the executable in `Program Files`
   - Add to PATH automatically
   - Create file associations for `.jhay` files

### What to Send:
- A single `.exe` installer file

### Installation:
Your friends just need to run the installer












## Option 3: Python Package Distribution

If your friends have Python installed:

### What to Send:
1. Your entire JhayScript folder (excluding `__pycache__` and `dist`)
2. Or package it with `setuptools`

### Installation:
```cmd
pip install /path/to/jhayscript/folder
```

## Setting Up File Associations (Optional)

To make `.jhay` files runnable by double-clicking:

```cmd
assoc .jhay=JhayScriptFile
ftype JhayScriptFile="C:\Path\To\jhayscript.exe" "%1"
```

## Complete User Guide to Share

**How to Install and Use JhayScript**

1. **Download** the JhayScript package from [your sharing method]
2. **Install**:
   - *If using .exe*: Place in a folder and add to PATH (see instructions above)
   - *If using installer*: Just run it
3. **Test Installation**:
   ```cmd
   jhayscript --version
   ```
4. **Write Scripts**:
   - Create files with `.jhay` extension
   - Example (`hello.jhay`):
     ```
     echo "Hello from JhayScript!"
     ```
5. **Run Scripts**:
   ```cmd
   jhayscript hello.jhay
   ```
6. (Optional) **Enable double-click** by setting file associations

## Troubleshooting Guide

1. **"Not recognized as command"**:
   - The PATH wasn't set correctly - recheck the installation
2. **Missing DLL errors**:
   - They might need to install the Visual C++ Redistributable
3. **File association issues**:
   - Run the association commands as Administrator

## Best Distribution Methods

1. **For non-technical friends**:
   - Create an installer (Option 2)
   - Include a README.txt with simple instructions

2. **For developer friends**:
   - Share the GitHub repository
   - Or send the Python package (Option 3)

3. **For quick testing**:
   - Just send the .exe and a sample script (Option 1)
